# PlaneCrash
An individual-work project using C++ and OpenGL (GLUT).
Currently includes the base game logic, base player and first enemy graphicsand first boss graphics and wing animation (NOT currently commited to this github). Has a life/death system, score system, passive increase of difficulty. 

Future work: Commit the first boss graphics and animations, implement first boss logic, add more enemies, high score system, menu system, better AI, code polishing.

To run: extract and double-click the Planes executable. Obs: Might require to change project folder permissions ( chmod -R 777 foldername). Running in full-screen is reccomended (else it might cause innacuracies).

Developed during the summer of 2018 (Between my first and second year at the Uni. of Warwick).
